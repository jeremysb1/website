## About Project

I wanted to keep my HTML and CSS skills sharp. And since I am a fan of project-based learning, I built a portfolio website with HTML and CSS.

## Technologies Used

HTML and CSS only.

## Getting Started

You know the drill. Fork the repository. Then clone, ideally with SSH, to your local environment.

You can also just click the GitHub Pages link.

## Roadmap

- Update the projects
- Add another way for folks to contact me
- Spice up the design
- More humor
